<p id="info_p">
Here at the zoo we have a wide variety of activities for everyone in the family to enjoy. So while your little ones are making new friends in the Petting Zoo, and Granny and Grandad are enjoying a nice cup of tea in the Café, you can enjoy one of our wonderous walks around the land, and take n some of the scenery the scottish borders has to offer.<br> <br>
If you want to get really close to our animals, this is the place to be. In the Animal Handling Hall our keepers will have you touching donkeys and stroking  lambs before you know it.
<br> <br>
But don’t worry if this doesn’t sound like your cup of tea. There are also cuddly creatures like guinea pigs and bunny rabbits as well as plenty of others to see and touch. There’s also the butterfly house to explore. <br> If you do decide to touch any of the animals in the Animal Handling Hall please make sure to wash your hands before and after – especially before eating any food <br>
Hey, that's pretty good. Hey, that's pretty good. Hey, that's pretty good. Hey, that's pretty good. Hey, that's pretty good. Hey, that's pretty good.
